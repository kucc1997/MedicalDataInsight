# May Sprint

## Overview 

On May 20, 2018 during an event titled " [GOOGLE I/O 2018 EXTENDED AT KATHMANDU UNIVERSITY](http://sigdelsanjog.com.np/blog/google-io-extended-at-kathmandu-university)", FOSS volunteer Mr. Sanjog Sigdel facilitated an Idea Incubation session for initiating an Open Source Project. Project initiation was targeted to groom suitable ideas either in health or education sector. About 13/35 participants pitched suitable ideas in both health and education. Pitched ideas can be found in link below:

Out of those ideas, health related ideas were more  interesting. Among health and education considering the ideas pitched by participants health was selected. All ideas were combined and facilitator proposed  initiating an Open Source Project on Health Sector. The idea basically was to build a Health Dashboard where one could search healthcare queries and view results in a meaningful presentation using visualization tools.

An email was sent to all participants to acknowledge their interest in contributing in the Open Source project such that we could proceed further for planning.
